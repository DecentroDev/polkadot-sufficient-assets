# Overview

**Polkadot-Sufficient-Assets UI Library** is a developer-friendly tool that simplifies the process of building asset transfer functionalities within the Polkadot ecosystem. The library supports two types of transfers: same-chain transfers and multi-chain transfers via XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging). Developers only need to configure the assets and chains to quickly integrate asset transfer features into their applications.

## Key Features

- **Same Chain Transfers**: Quickly configure and transfer assets within the same chain.
- **Multi-Chain Transfers**: Leverage XCM to transfer assets across different chains.
- **Configurable Tokens and Chains**: Support for native and non-native tokens, with easy configuration for custom chains and assets.
